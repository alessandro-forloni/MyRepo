\subsection{Our Approach}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Our Approach}

The "schedule" we set at the beginning is to find firstly a satisfactory method to switch strategies on and off and then move to the part of risk-weight allocation. We will consider the first step to be completed once the resulting selection allows for efficient trading of maximum a hundredth of strategies with at least half of the trading days with positive pnl. Unfortunately, using very trivial benchmarks is not possible as we will show later with statistics on the data. That means that we will simply choose the best method out of the ones we will elaborate.\\
To achieve this step a simple and robust feature-based approach has been used. We decided not to try to use any hard-core machine learning type approach to reduce the risk of overfitting and to fit the specificity of the problem. In fact, the abundance of strategies and the lack of a long samples would have made training a machine learning method cumbersome and time-consuming.\\
Before getting into this part, relevant features (related exclusively to performance, the only information we have at hand) are needed to give some predictive insight to our models. To this end we built several different features and evaluated their predictive power through a \textit{Random Forest Tree} (details of this model will be provided later).\\
For what concerns assigning the weights we developed two different approaches, one of which is more computationally oriented and the other is more diversification-driven. The first approach is to train a genetic portfolio allocator that will select the best portfolio in-sample and then trade it out of sample. The second approach is based on clustering, and aims at reducing as much as possible the realized variance of the portfolio. The real step forward we are trying to put in place is to use a rigorous and robust statistical approach that uses the experience of machine learning research on much simpler algorithms to enrich the power of linear predictors. We will make use of robust feature importance assessment, we will separate in-sample and out-of-sample periods strictly and we will use adaptive methods that need to work with the minimum number of parameters as possible.\\

\section{Part 1: Strategy Selection}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Part 1: Strategy Selection}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Problem Statement}

We give here an additional re-statement of the problem we try to tackle here. On each Monday, we have to allocate risk on each of the given strategies by choosing which ones to put into production for the following week. In an ideal world we would switch on all the strategies that will perform well during the following week and vice-versa with the bad ones. Unfortunately this is quite an impossible task, and we just seek a "statistical edge" that allows us to profit from appropriate selection of strategies on the long run.\\
For this first part we focus only on activating or de-activating the algorithms, we don't care about the risk weight to give to strategies (the output will be a $\{1,0\}$ signal). In more mathematical terms let's define each week the vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where $N$ is the number of assets. This vector will be composed only of zeros or ones. Let's also consider the vector $\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ that contains all the returns of each strategy over the next week. Our weekly problem can be formulated as:


\begin{equation} \label{problem_statement}
\argmax \limits_{\mathbf{w}} \quad sharpe\_ratio(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{r}) + sortino\_ratio(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}

As you can see we will look at both Sharpe Ratio and Sortino-Ratio to evaluate the performance of our portfolio-building model.
Of course we don't have a closed formula solution for this problem. We will implement algorithmic procedures aiming to achieve this target.\\

\subsection{Switching Model}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Switching Model}

Here we face the challenge of finding an optimal subset of all the strategies to put in production for a given week. The model here should just tell us whether a strategy is good or bad for the coming week.\\
As opposed to a traditional machine learning model, we want something more simple, interpretable and faster. Following the results of our random forest tree classifier we decided to base our models on robust thresholds or ranking of strategies. The reasons for dropping cutting-edge machine learning methods in this context are multiple:

\begin{itemize}
	\item first we don't have many samples per strategy to be able to train machine learning models. So would somehow have to mix training and results for all the strategies.
	\item If we had more data, a Neural Network could for example learn the complex relationships between feature behaviour and future performance of the strategy, but since we have little amounts of data per strategy this could be hardly achievable.
	\item It is quite clear that in this context we are aiming at training individually each strategy, as trying to fit many different strategies in one model is definitely not optimal.
	\item At last, we want our model to have some "economic sense" and underlying intuition to be more understandable and controllable. We want to avoid using black-boxes that we don't know how to control.
\end{itemize} 
  
We have tested several different models and evaluated them based on the performance they provided. This performance is not only a function of raw PnL, but is at first risk-adjusted and secondarily it takes into account how volatile the allocation is. It is well established that some interesting theoretical models just don't work in the real world because of transaction-costs and implementation issues. We want to avoid falling into this problem, finding something that works really well in-sample but then requires to completely reshuffle the portfolio each week killing any kind of intrinsic alpha.
Each model will require to fit various parameters, therefore we will perform in-sample gridsearches looking for pseudo-optimal parameters trying to avoid overfitting. That means we will look at the results with common sense, if we will find very surprising numbers we will dwelve in the nature of these parameters, and eventually we might not validate the results we see.\\

\section{Part 2: Risk Allocation}

Once we have a robust and trustworthy selection method, we can move our scope towards risk minimization, or in more precise terms, Sharpe-Ratio maximization. We will build on top of the selected portfolio two different weights systems that will be benchmarked against a simple equally weighted portfolio and a Markowitz-like minimum variance portfolio (see appendix for building details). As it was for the switching problem, our aim is still to find the best out-of-sample portfolio for the following week (setting the new weights on Monday) given information up to the previous Friday. We want to allocate risk to the set of strategies that we know can perform well in a way that we exploit relationships between assets to achieve a high level of diversification.\\
The methods will be compared for how they will perform in the out-of-sample dataset. The In-sample dataset will be used for optimization if required.\\
