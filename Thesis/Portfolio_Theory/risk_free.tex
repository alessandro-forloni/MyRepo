At this point, In traditional books, the discussion on portfolios extends including risk-free assets. A risk-free asset is an asset that provides returns without any risk. That means that even in the worst case scenario this asset will pay back the invested capital and the accrued return or interest. As a result, the expected return on such an asset is lower than that of any stock or risky asset. A totally risk-averse investor will invest only in risk-free assets. Such an asset is usually considered to be a safe sovereign bond (core Europe bonds or US bonds) or bank accounts. There is still a little risk in them but the probability of defualt of such bonds is so little that they are usually considered as non risk-bearing. \\
In our analysis we will, ignore the existece of risk free assets since in our case the only risk-free alternative to investing in algorithmic trading strategies is to leave the cash univested at a zero interest-rate. In such a case, if we are risk-averse we would jus not invest any money in the market.
